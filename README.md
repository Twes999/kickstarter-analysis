# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

# Results
-The highest number of successful happened at the end of Spring/start of summer. 
-An end of the year launch date has the same outcome of either successful or failure.
-For the Outcomes Based on Goals, the conclusion I came to was the higher you set your funding goal the higher probability the outcome will be failure.
